# librarys
```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.std_logic_1164.all;      -- contains std_logic and std_logic_vector (and more) 
use IEEE.numeric_std.all;         -- contains unsigned and signed arithmetics
```

# entities
```vhdl
entity multiplexer is
  port(
    a, b: in std_logic;
    s: in std_logic;
    c: out std_logic    -- no semicolon here!
  );
end entity multiplexer;
```
- blackbox view defining inputs and outputs

# architectures
```vhdl
architecture multiplexer_logic of multiplexer is
begin
  c <= a when s = '0' else
       b when s = '1';
end multiplexer_logic;
```
- whitebox view defining the logic, always belonging to an entity
- there can be multiple architectures for a single entity
- you cannot write to inputs!
- you cannot read from outputs!
- all assignments are processes!
  - all processes happen in parallel!
  - a signal takes its state at the end of a process!
  - that means that assigning a value to a signal in one process won't affect another process using that signal (not in the same "loop")!
- use signals to reuse your "output"!

## types of architectures

There are three types of architectures. I'll explain them by implementing following 1-mux:

```vhdl
entity multiplexer is
  port(
    a, b: in std_logic;
    s: in std_logic;
    c: out std_logic
  );
end entity multiplexer;
```

### 1. structural

"The description of a structural body is based on component instantiation and generate statements."

That means first of all we create a component for each logic gate we need. Then we use these logic gates to exactly define the multiplexer's structure.

![Unbenannt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29947316/150628231-17eb978c-0215-4756-98e2-5dd5e9050c56.PNG)

```vhdl
architecture structural of multiplexer is

component and_gate
  port(a, b: in std_logic; c: out std_logic);
end component;
component or_gate
  port(a, b: in std_logic; c: out std_logic);
end component;
component not_gate
  port(a: in std_logic; b: out std_logic);
end component;

signal s_not: std_logic;
signal first_and: std_logic;
signal second_and: std_logic;

begin
   n1: not_gate port map(s, s_not);
   a1: and_gate port map(a, s_not, first_and);
   a2: and_gate port map(b, s, second_and);
   o1: or_gate port map(first_and, second_and, c);
end structural;
```

### 2. dataflow
"The Dataflow description is built with concurrent signal assignment statements. Each of the statements can be activated when any of its input signals changes its value."

That means we just use simple assignments and logical operators.


```vhdl
architecture dataflow of multiplexer is

begin
   c <= (a and not s) or (b and s);
end dataflow;
```

### 3. behavioural
"The architecture body describes only the expected functionality (behavior) of the circuit, without any direct indication as to the hardware implementation. Such description consists only of one or more processes, each of which contains sequential statements."

```vhdl
architecture behavioural of multiplexer is

begin
   process(a, b, s)
   begin
      if(s = '1') then
        c <= b;
      else
        c <= a;
      end if;
   end process;
end behavioural;
```

## reusing entities
```vhdl
architecture structural of full_adder is
signal s1, s2, s3: bit;
component half_adder  -- 1. define the reused component's black box view inside the architecture's declarative part
  port (
    x, y : in bit;
    sum, cout : out bit
  );
end component;
begin
  u1 : half_adder port map (x, y, s1, s2);  -- 2. map (input/output) signals to the reused component
  u2 : half_adder port map (s1, cin, sum, s3);
  cout <= s2 OR s3;
end structural;
```

# signals
```vhdl
architecture some_random_architecture of some_random_entity is
signal internal_signal: std_logic;
begin
  internal_signal <= a xor internal_signal;
  c <= internal_signal;
end some_random_architecture;
```
- useful for reusing "outputs"
- are declared inside the architecture's declarative part

## initialising signals
```vhdl
signal internal_signal: std_logic := '1';
``` 
- remember: intialization isn't synthesizable!

# processes
```vhdl
process(clk)
begin
  if(rising_edge(clk) then
    a <= '1';
  else
    a <= '0';
  end if;
end process;
```
- processes are only "called" if the value of at least one signal in the sensitivity list changes
- common assignments (outside a process) are processes too, all processes happen in parallel!
- signals take their states at the end of a process

## if-statements
```vhdl
if (a = '1') or (c > d) then
  statements;
elsif condition then
  statements;
else
  statements;
end if;
```
- can only be used inside processes
- elsif and else clauses are optional

## case-statements
```vhdl
case a is
  when "00" => b <= "1000";
  when "01" => b <= "0100";
  when "10" => b <= "0010";
  when "11" => b <= "0001";
  when others => b <= "0000"; -- fallback case
  -- when others =>; -- commonly used to do "nothing"
end case;
```

# assignments

## simple assignments
```vhdl
a <= '1';
```

## when else assignments
```vhdl
a <= "11" when b = "00" else
     "10" when b = "01" else
     "01" when b = "10" else
     "00" when b = "11";
```
its also possible to define a fallback value
```vhdl
a <= "11" when b = "00" else
     "10" when b = "01" else
     "01" when b = "10" else
     "00" when b = "11" else
     "00";
```

## with select assignments
this is equal to the code above
```vhdl
with b select a <= 
     "11" when "00",  -- use commas here
     "10" when "01",
     "01" when "10",
     "00" when "11",
     "00" when others; -- fallback value
```

# operators

## arithmetical
`+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `mod`

## relational
`=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`

## logical
`not`, `or`, `and`, `xor`, `nand`, `nor` and `xnor`.
`not` has the highest precendence, all other operators have the same precendence (!). so just use parenthesis^^.

```vhdl
c <= a or not b or (f and (g xor h));
```

## concatentation-operator
`&` is an operator allowing you to concatenate vectors.
```vhdl
signal a: std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
signal b: std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
signal c: std_logic_vector(8 downto 0);
(...)
c <= a & b;
```

# datatypes

## simple

### boolean
can be `true` or `false`. used for conditions.

### bit
can be `1` or `0`. represents a signal.

### std_logic
the better bit. can be `0` (logic 0, all fine), `1` (logic 1, all fine), `Z` (high impendence), `-` (don't care), `U` (uninitialised, cannot know), `X` (unknown, can't determine), `L` (weak signal, probably 0), `H` (weak signal, probably 1), `W` (weak signal, can't tell).
useful for detecting errors while simulating.

## vectors / arrays
vectors are array-like one-dimensional collections of signals having the same type. they are indexed by an integer number starting with 0.

### defining ranges
- `downto` corresponds to _little endian_
- `to` correspons to _big endian_

**e.g.**
```vhdl
signal big_endian : std_logic_vector(0 to 7) := "0000_0001";        -- results in index 7 having the value '1'
signal little_endian : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := "0000_0001"; -- results in index 0 having the value '1'
```

### assigning arrays
#### assigning single elements
```vhdl
my_array(0) <= '1';
```
#### assigning a part of the array
```vhdl
my_array(3 downto 0) <= "0101";
```
#### positional association
```vhdl
my_array <= ('0', '1', '0', '1');
```
#### named association
```vhdl
my_array <= (0 => '1', others => '0');            -- 0000_0001
my_array <= (0 | 3 | 5 => '1', others => '0');    -- 0010_1001
my_array <= (4 downto 1 => '1', others => '0');   -- 0001_1110
```

### creating custom vector types
first you have to define your array type:
```vhdl
type 4bit_vector is array(3 downto 0) of bit;
```
after that you can simple use it:
```vhdl
signal a: 4bit_vector;
```

### std_logic_vector
represents a vector of bits (std_logic). does not support arithmetics.
```vhdl
signal a: std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
```

### unsigned
represents a vector of bits (std_logic) supporting unsigned arithmetics.
```vhdl
signal a: unsigned(7 downto 0) := 7;  -- default value is 'U' (uninitialised) to every bit
(...)
a <= a + 1;
```

### signed
represents a vector of bits (std_logic) supporting signed arithmetics.
```vhdl
signal a: signed(7 downto 0) := -7;  -- default value is 'U' (uninitialised) to every bit
(...)
a <= a + 1;
```

### integer
represents an integer. similar to signed/unsigned.
but you
- cannot assign binary or hex values
- cannot use bitwise/logical operators
- cannot set the bit count using `(8 downto 0)` or `(0 to 3)`
  - instead you have to use `range value1 to value2`-syntax
- cannot access single bits
```vhdl
signal a_number: integer range -256 to 255;
```
